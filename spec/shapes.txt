# Text in 3D will need to be based upon a rectangle in 3D (not yet
# possible without a transform).  Should label alignment be specified
# directly in the representation, or in higher-level metadata?
52	Text	2D	Text (label)
# Constrain region to a single value within a specific dimension.
53	Value	nD	A value in an arbitrary dimension
# Constrain region to multiple values within a specific dimension.
54	Values	nD	A set of values in an arbitrary dimension
# Constrain region to a range of values within a specific dimension.
55	Range	nD	A range of values in an arbitrary dimension
# There are no limits in the additional dimension; these must be set
# by combining with a range instead.
56	Extrude	nD	Extrude a shape of arbitrary dimensionality into an additional dimension.
# The result is a shape combining all subset dimensions.
# It is illegal to have a common dimension between the two shapes.
