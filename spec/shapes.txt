#ShapeID	Shape	Dims	Description

## 3D geometric forms with no intrinsic volume

0	Point	3D	A single point
1	Points	3D	A set of points
2	Line	3D	A single line
3	Lines	3D	A set of lines
4	Polyline	3D	A set of connected points (open)
5	Polygon	3D	A set of connected points (closed)
6	PolylineSpline	3D	A set of connected splines (open)
7	PolygonSpline	3D	A set of connected splines (closed)
8	Arc	3D	An arc

## 3D geometric forms with intrinsic volume

10	Cuboid	3D	A cuboid
11	Ellipsoid	3D	An ellipsoid
12	Cylinder	3D	An elliptic cylinder
13	Mesh	3D	A mesh

## 3D pixel data

30	BitMask	3D	A mask with one bit values
31	GreyMask	3D	A mask with multiple grey levels

## 3D transformations and operations

40	AffineTransform	3D	Affine transformation of a shape
41	AbstractTransform	3D	Abstract (implementation-defined) transformation of a shape
42	Bitwise	3D	Binary bitwise operation

## nD constraints

# Constrain region to a single value within a specific dimension.
50	Value	nD	A value in an arbitrary dimension
# Constrain region to multiple values within a specific dimension.
51	Values	nD	A set of values in an arbitrary dimension
# Constrain region to a range of values within a specific dimension.
52	Range	nD	A range of values in an arbitrary dimension
# There are no limits in the additional dimension; these must be set
# by combining with a range instead.

## nD transformations and shape operations

60	Extrude	nD	Extrude a shape of arbitrary dimensionality into an additional dimension.
# The result is a shape combining all subset dimensions.
# It is illegal to have a common dimension between the two shapes.
61	Combine	nD	Combine shapes of differing dimensionality

## Annotations

# Text in 3D will need to be based upon a rectangle in 3D (not yet
# possible without a transform).  Should label alignment be specified
# directly in the representation, or in higher-level metadata?
100	Text	3D	Text (label)
101	Scale	3D	A scale bar between two points
102	Grid	3D	A scale grid in a defined volume
