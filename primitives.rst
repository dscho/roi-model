Geometric shape primitives
==========================

Overview
--------

This section specifies how shapes are described in the model.  For
some shapes, there are several alternative ways of specifying them;
which are worth supporting needs further dicussion.  One point to
consider is that the different ways preserve the intent behind the
original measurement and what is in the original metadata where this
makes sense, even if this does mean some redundancy; this won't impact
on the actual drawing/analysis code, which can deal with each shape in
a canonical form.  Additionally, while some shapes have been included
here for completeness, it's quite possible that not all are needed,
particularly in all dimensions.

If anyone wants to check the maths behind the geometry, that would be
much appreciated, because I'm firstly not an expert in this area, and
it's also quite possible I've made some typos.  The naming of the
shapes is probably also wanting some improvement.

Basic primitives
----------------

Basic primitives describing vertices and vectors:

========= ============== ============
Primitive Representation Description
========= ============== ============
Vertex1D  double[1]      Vertex in 1D
Vertex2D  double[2]      Vertex in 2D
Vertex3D  double[3]      Vertex in 3D
Vector1D  double[1]      Vector in 1D
Vector2D  double[2]      Vector in 2D
Vector3D  double[3]      Vector in 3D
========= ============== ============

All shape primitives are described in terms of the above basic
primitives.  This means that all shape descriptions are serialisable
as a list of double precision floating point values.  It also means
that for compatible shape types, the shape type may be changed while
retaining the point list (e.g. polyline, polygon spline).

All 2D shape primitives could be oriented in 3D or using a unit
Vector3D, which would allow all 2D shapes to be used as surfaces in
3D.  They would additionally require a depth in order to be meaningful
(or assume a depth of one z slice).

.. todo::
    Common methods for all primitives:
    Bounding box [AlignedCuboid3D]
    Rotation centre [Vertex2D/Vertex3D]
    Control points [may use points and vertex to describe position and movement path]
    Conversion to 2D (slab through); equivalent to intersection with cuboid.  Should
    all primitives support a minimum of intersection with AlignedCuboid3D?  Or Mesh3D
    for non-square images.
    Can 2D methods use alternative axes to project in xz/yz?  Default
    to xy.  If all 2D shapes must be represented by 3D forms (i.e. are
    just proxies), then the equivalent 3D can be used quite simply.
    Get greymap/bitmap.
    Intersect (only for cuboid?)  Need to clip to image volume
    (optionally).  Also useful to reduce to 2D (which can be a cuboid
    for a single plane).
    Non-aligned shapes inherit/implement the aligned forms.

    Masks

Masks
-----

Masks may be either grey masks (double or integer) or bitmasks.

For all of the following masks, DATA should be stored outside the ROI
specification either as BinData or (better) in an IFD for OME-TIFF.
It could be stored as part of the double array, but this would be
quite inefficient.

.. note::
   Masks are applied to the bounding rectangle, and so a 1:1
   correspondance between mask and image pixel data is not required.
   In this case, a new greymask should be computed which is aligned
   with the pixel data, and then (if required) thresholded to a
   bitmask.

    Meshes

Meshes
------


Mesh representation depends upon the mesh format.  In the examples
below, face-vertex meshes are used.

.. index::
    Mesh2D

Mesh2D
^^^^^^

Representation:

===== ================ ====================================================
Name  Type             Description
===== ================ ====================================================
NFACE double           Number of faces
VREF  double[NFACE][3] Vertex references per face, counterclockwise winding
NVERT double           Number of vertices
VERTS Vertex2D[NVERT]  Vertex coordinates
===== ================ ====================================================

Vertex references are indexes into the VERTS array.  Vertex-face
mapping is implied, and will require the implementor to construct the
mapping.

.. index::
    Mesh3D

Mesh3D
^^^^^^

Representation:

===== ================ ====================================================
Name  Type             Description
===== ================ ====================================================
NFACE double           Number of faces
VREF  double[NFACE][3] Vertex references per face, counterclockwise winding
NVERT double           Number of vertices
VERTS Vertex3D[NVERT]  Vertex coordinates
===== ================ ====================================================

Vertex references are indexes into the VERTS array.  Vertex-face
mapping is implied, and will require the implementor to construct the
mapping.

.. index::
    Text2D

Text2D
^^^^^^

Representation 1: Text aligned relative to a point.  Inherits all
Point2D and Point3D representations.

Representation 2: Text aligned relative to a line.  Inherits all
Line2D and Line3D, Direction2D and Direction3D representations.
    
Representation 3: Text aligned and flowed inside a rectangle.
Inherits all AlignedSquare2D, Square2D, AlignedRectangle2D and
Rectangle2D representations.

.. index::
    Scale bars

Scale bars
----------

.. index::
    Scale2D

Scale2D
^^^^^^^

Representation 1: Scale bar between two points.  Inherits all Line2D representations.

Representation 1: Scale bar described by vector.  Inherits all Distance2D representations.

.. index::
    Scale3D

Scale3D
^^^^^^^

Representation 1: Scale bar between two points.  Inherits all Line3D representations

Representation 1: Scale bar described by vector.  Inherits all Distance3D representations.

.. note::
    A 3D scale may need to be a 3D grid to allow visualisation of
    perspective, in which case the representation will define the grid
    bounding cuboid; inherit AlignedCuboid3D representations.  Permit
    scale rotation with Cuboid3D?  Allow specification of grid size
    and only allow sizing in discrete units?
